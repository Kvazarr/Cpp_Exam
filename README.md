# Battleship Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Battleship game in C++. It allows two players to play against each other in a turn-based naval combat.

## Rules of the Game

- Each player has a fleet of ships placed on a 9x9 grid.
- Players take turns guessing the coordinates to target their opponent's ships.
- The game ends when one player has successfully sunk all of the opponent's ships.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with intuitive user interface.
- Randomized ship placement for each game session.
- Display of game board and ship positions.
- Feedback on successful hits, misses, and sunk ships.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Build and run the project using a C++ compiler.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter player names and make ship placements.
4. Take turns entering coordinates to target opponent's ships.
5. Continue playing until one player wins the game.

## Dependencies

The project has no external dependencies and can be built using a standard C++ compiler.
